	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hi! My names Todd. I'm a Web Developer! well sorta.. I am a beguiner web developer, but is there realy a need differentiate? I've built websites using HTML, CSS, Java Script, Jquery, and PHP. I've watched a bagilion hours of tutorials on YouTube about how to build webpages, how to make a site live and tons of other stuff but I so i feel a bit more like an intermediant web developer somtimes.. and then on ocassion I'm asked a quesiton or faced with a problem that sends me right back to stackoverflow and reduces the size of my confidence just a bit. </p>
	<p>Asside form building webpages though I'm also a Carpenter.. again I'm just a novice but I love building things out of wood. Especialy things that are funtional <u>and</u> beautiful. I'm also a kind of a jack of all trades.. but you know what they say <i>Jack of all Trades, Master of None..</i> which means if you need something done, fixed, made, or anything really, I probably have an idea on how to do said thing and enough confidence to try. However I'm not promising perfection here!</p>
	<p>I love working on computers, I build my own for gaming and work. I'm and IT buy by trade... okay so I man a simply helpdesk that helps companies out with simply desktop problems.. i.e. permissions, networking, wifi, password resets... you get the point. really though my goal is to lear to code. I want to make programs that do things! That automate simple tasks and bring about the New Era of the Machine! jk I'm not crazy or anyting. But that its my goal. I want to Code.</p>
	<p>Currently I am 3 classes away from and A.S. in Computer Science. with a focus in moble and application development. I feel like YouTube has taught me more than college. However college gave me structer and a reason to learn from YouTube. I may not be crazy but when it comes to student loans I am a cynic. Not not just a beguiner one either. I am excited thoguh to move to Logan Utah this fall though as I'll be transfering there to continue my studies to get a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
	<p>Over all I'm a pretty nerdy guy. I play video games. I watch Star Wars. My friends and I have inside jokes about science and computers and we all love the K-Face song parodys like 'Talk Nerdy to Me'  <img src="res/nerd.png" style="width:25px;"> we know all the words and trust me that's something I'm proud of!</p>
